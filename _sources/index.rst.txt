Inductive Design Exploration Method (IDEM)
------------------------------------------
The Inductive Design Exploration Method (IDEM) is a robust multi-level design method that accounts for uncertainty propagation through process-structure-property-performance (PSPP) mappings, involving either experimental data, model simulations, or reduced order surrogate models.  IDEM combines several steps to seeking top-down (inductive) materials design exploration, based on bottom-up (deductive) process-structure, structure-property and property-performance relations, discretized ranges of parameters associated with these relations or mappings, with recursive function evaluation to identify robust solutions to materials design problems

pyDEM
------
Utilizing a Python-scripted framework for IDEM, the Python Design Exploration Method (pyDEM) implements a fully general IDEM instantiation that allows for the linkage of input variables, objective functions, and levels or mappings. A short introduction is covered in the examples section. Any additional code or example contributions are welcome.
