# Inductive Design Exploration Method (IDEM)
The Inductive Design Exploration Method (IDEM) is a robust method for accounting for uncertainty propagation through multi-level problems. IDEM combines several solution-finding strategies, such as top-down (inductive) and bottom-up (deductive) design exploration, discretized ranges of parameters, with recursive function evaluation to identify robust solutions to materials design problems. This approach lends itself to developing process-structure-property-performance (PSPP) mappings of material systems, and can help identify materials of interest for future exploration.

# pyDEM
Utilizing a Python-scripted framework for IDEM, the Python Design Exploration Method (pyDEM) implements a fully general IDEM instantiation that allows for the linkage of input variables, objective functions, and levels or mappings. A short introduction is covered in the examples section. Any additional code or example contributions are welcome.
